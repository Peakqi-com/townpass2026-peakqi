# What is Town Pass?

Town Pass is an open-source project developed by the Taipei City Government. With the growth of smart cities, the demand for digitalization in city management and citizen services continues to rise. As we enter a new digital era, our goal is to involve citizens in the process, combining third-party expertise and innovation to make digital life in Taipei more convenient.

Town Pass is not just an application; it is an open community project. Through open-source, every citizen can participate in the ideation, development, and optimization of the application. This not only enhances citizen engagement and satisfaction but also leverages collective intelligence to continuously improve the application, making it truly serve the people. Furthermore, we hope that various municipalities can widely adopt the open-source framework of Town Pass, integrate it with their existing municipal service systems, and quickly have their own applications to enhance digital governance.

Open source is a key driver of technological progress and social development. Through open-source, Town Pass will become an ever-evolving platform, attracting developers from all backgrounds to contribute. We welcome experts to submit code, report issues, provide suggestions, and even develop new features and creative ideas, working together to perfect Town Pass as we advance toward a smart city.
